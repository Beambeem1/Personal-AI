Problem Statement
Old Solutions:

Heavy reliance on CCTV footage reviewed by security staff.
Over 15,000 cameras in southern provinces.
Problems Identified:

Big Data Storage: Managing and analyzing vast CCTV footage is resource-intensive.
Privacy Concerns: Collecting data on specific groups raises privacy issues.
Potential for Misuse: Databases of at-risk people and vehicles could be misused, leading to discriminatory practices.
Limited Investigative Tools: Relying on traditional methods like witness testimony and forensic evidence is time-consuming and inefficient.
Objectives for Improvement:

Enhanced Police Proficiency: Train officers to use AI-powered tools on smartphones for crime analysis.
Increased Public Confidence: Implement AI-powered CCTV for transparent crime monitoring.
Real-time Crime Prevention: Develop AI systems to alert police to suspicious individuals or vehicles via mobile devices.
Challenges to Address:

System Design: Develop a robust and secure system for crime prevention using AI.
Ethical Integration: Integrate AI into investigative practices with careful attention to data handling and ethics.
Criminal Behavior Analysis: Understand and predict criminal behavior through data analysis.
Methodology
Detection: AI algorithms continuously analyze data to detect suspicious activity or known criminals.
Tracking: Once a target is detected, the system tracks its movements across different stations.
Recognition: AI compares detected individuals or vehicles with data in the database to identify them.
Alerts: If a match is found, an alert with relevant information (location, direction, criminal history) is sent to officers.
Response: Officers can use this information to apprehend suspects efficiently.
Conclusion
Boosting Police Efficiency: AI tools will help officers analyze crime data and streamline investigations.
Enhancing Crime Prevention: Intelligent CCTV systems will provide real-time monitoring and evidence recording, improving public trust in security.
Proactive Intervention: AI algorithms will detect suspicious activity and send instant alerts to police, enabling quick responses to potential threats.
