Problem Statement
Nanopore sequencing is a novel technology that can directly sequence RNA molecules.
It measures raw electrical signal data at each nucleotide position along the RNA strand.
This signal data contains information about RNA modifications like m6A methylation.
The goal is to develop a computational method to accurately locate modified positions and quantify modification rates from nanopore data.
Data Collection and Preparation
Nanopore sequencing produces raw signal data in FAST5 format.
Basecalled sequence data is output in FASTQ format.
A reference genome is provided in FASTA format.
The data is preprocessed by aligning to the reference and aggregating into event-level data.
Each event represents the raw signal for a k-mer in the original RNA sequence.
Modeling
A Bayesian multi-sample Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used.
It models the distribution of electrical signal levels at each genomic position.
The Expectation Maximization algorithm is used to fit parameters of the GMM.
Each position is modeled as a mixture of 2 Gaussians, representing unmodified and modified states.
The model is trained on multiple samples together to improve statistical power.
Evaluation
The model achieves 86% AUC on a held-out test set for detecting known m6A modifications.
It provides interpretable modification rate estimates that closely match expected levels.
It performs well on a variety of tissue types and cell lines.
The model enables the discovery of differentially modified positions between conditions.
Future Work
Potential improvements, like an end-to-end model directly from raw signal data.
Investigation of different model architectures, such as deep autoencoders.
Extending the model to detect additional RNA modification types beyond m6A.
